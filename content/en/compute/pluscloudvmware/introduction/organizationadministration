## Organization administration

The Administration menu item takes you to the overview for users, groups and account settings. Here you can add further users to your organization and manage their rights (roles).
Our support is of course also available for this and other topics.

{{< screenshot src="img/help.png" title="Help menu" >}} You can find extensive help in technical portal details at VMware Online using the question mark in the top right corner. {{< /screenshot >}}

### Roles, users and groups

The sub-items Users, Groups and Roles can be found under the Access control menu item.
You can create additional users to log into the vCloud Director via Users and the New button.

The following parameters can be configured:
{{< screenshot src="img/parameters.png" title="Parameters" >}}
Username: Username for the login

    Password: Password for the login

    Confirm password: Confirmation of the password

    State: Activate or deactivate user account after creation

    Available roles: Determine user rights via a predefined role

    Full name: Name of the user (optional)

    Email address: Email address of the user (optional)

    Phone number: Phone number of the user (optional)
    
User groups should generally be set up under Groups. This tab has no function in the current release.

Predefined roles can already be found under Roles. A role always contains a collection of rights for a user. You can use the New button to create additional customised roles that can then be used for new users:

#### Limitation to individual instances

By configuring users in the **vApp User** role, it is also possible to restrict access to individual vApps and thus indirectly to VMs:
